Testing plan for today:



- ROS1 packages my P.C  (Linux -ROS1)








- Mobula software ( Windows - ROS2)







Mobula has ROS2 packages,  inside mobule we can run a ROS1-ROS2 bridge.
On my comupter we run ROS1 and the packages and send it to the host computer (Mobula with a ROS bridge)



ROS package sends wrench commands, Mobula sends PWM commands to the ROV and receives state estimates and sends it to ROS
